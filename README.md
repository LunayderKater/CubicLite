Tiny Bedrock Server GUI

**Everything is still in planing! No hopes, just dreams!**

## What is CubicLite?
CL the small brother of CubicControl is a very small Bedrock Server GUI designed for the basic needs of:
- seeing who is online
- seeing the log

## Why CubicLite if there is CubicControl?
CubicControl is a heavy truck while CubicLite is Sonic. Or lets make it simple.
CC is thick boy.
